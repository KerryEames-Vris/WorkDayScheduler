# WorkDayScheduler

## Description
This was supposed to be a work day planner. You can enter the text into each hour timeblock and save the information to the local storage so as to not lose it. The timeblocks were meant to be color coded for past hours, the current hour, and future hours. I was unable to stipulate on each hour in comparison to the current time. I also was able to make the save buttons save the current text in the text areas to local storage, and keep those values upon reloading, but local storage saved everything as null and I looked for hours as to why and found no answer anywhere.

## Installation
1. Select the clone option from the repository page and copy the SSH link.
2. Navigate your terminal of choice to the directory you'd like the repository to be stored in.
3. Enter "git clone " and paste the copied SSH link into the terminal and run the command.
4. Open the HTML and CSS files using your preferred code editing software

## Usage
Use it to imagine you were making notes for your daily schedule, as separated by hours
